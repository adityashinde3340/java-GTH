        Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (Portuguese pronunciation:
        [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu duʃ ˈsɐ̃tuʃ aˈvej.ɾu] ⓘ; born 5 February 1985) is a
        Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for, and
        captains, both Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr and the Portugal national
        team. Nicknamed CR7, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest
        players in history, and has won numerous individual accolades throughout
        his career, including five Ballon d'Ors, a record three UEFA Men's
        Player of the Year Awards, four European Golden Shoes, and was named
        five times the world's best player by FIFA.[note 3] He has won 34
        trophies in his career, including five UEFA Champions Leagues and the
        UEFA European Championship. He holds the records for most goals (140)
        and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals (14) and assists (8) in
        the European Championship, and most international appearances (226) and
        international goals (143). He is the only player to have scored 100
        goals with four different clubs. He has made over 1,300 professional
        career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over
        950 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the
        top goalscorer of all time.

        Born in Funchal, Madeira, Ronaldo began his career with Sporting CP
        before signing with Manchester United in 2003. He became a star player
        at United, where he won three consecutive Premier League titles, the
        Champions League, and the FIFA Club World Cup. His 2007–08 season earned
        him his first Ballon d'Or at age 23. In 2009, Ronaldo became the subject
        of the then-most expensive transfer in history when he joined Real
        Madrid in a deal worth €94 million (£80 million). At Madrid, he was at
        the forefront of the club's resurgence as a dominant European force,
        helping them win four Champions Leagues between 2014 and 2018, including
        the long-awaited La Décima. He also won two La Liga titles, including
        the record-breaking 2011–12 season in which Madrid reached 100 points,
        and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. He won Ballon d'Ors in
        2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times to Lionel
        Messi, his perceived career rival. Following issues with the club
        hierarchy, Ronaldo signed for Juventus in 2018 in a transfer worth an
        initial €100 million, where he was pivotal in winning two Serie A
        titles. In 2021, he returned to United before joining Al-Nassr in 2023.
